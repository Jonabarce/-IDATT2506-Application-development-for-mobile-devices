    "rule1": "Start with the given numbers: Begin by identifying the numbers that are already filled in on the grid. These are your starting points and will help you make progress.",
    "rule2": "Use logic: Sudoku is a game of logic. Look for rows, columns, or regions where a specific number is missing, and logically deduce where it should go.",
