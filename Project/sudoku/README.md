How to run it on android:


There are two possibilities. 
If you have an Android emulator up and running through android studio, for example, all you have to do is open the project, run npm install (if it's the first time opening the project), and then when it's finished run npx expo start. When the server is up and running you can press "a" in the terminal and it will automatically open the app on the emulator.

If you want to use a physical mobile phone, you must first download Expo Go, register, and then scan the QR code that appears in the terminal when running npx expo start
